<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:160%;">Mark Sinclair Vincent[1][5] was born on July 18, 1967,[6] in Alameda County, California,[7] where his mother was also born, though he later moved to New York City with his fraternal twin brother, Paul.[8][9] His mother, Delora Sherleen Vincent (née Sinclair), is an astrologer.[10] He was raised by his white mother and adoptive African-American father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theater manager.[9][11][12] Diesel has stated that he is "of ambiguous ethnicity."[13] His mother has Scottish roots.[14] He has never met his biological father, and has said that "all I know from my mother is that I have connections to many different cultures";[15] Diesel believes that his parents' relationship would have been illegal in parts of the United States due to anti-miscegenation laws.[16]

Diesel made his stage debut at age seven when he appeared in the children's play Dinosaur Door, written by Barbara Garson. The play was produced at Theater for the New City in New York's Greenwich Village. His involvement in the play came about when he, his brother and some friends had broken into the Theater for the New City space on Jane Street with the intent to vandalize it. They were confronted by the theater's artistic director, Crystal Field, who offered them roles in the upcoming show instead of calling the police.[17][18][19] Diesel remained involved with the theater throughout adolescence, going on to attend Hunter College in New York City, where studies in creative writing led him to begin screenwriting. He has identified himself as a "multi-faceted" actor.[20]</p>
